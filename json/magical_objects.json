    "use": "This motorbike was a magical motorcycle owned by Harry Potter that previously belonged to his godfather, Sirius Black, which Harry inherited after Sirius was killed by Bellatrix Lestrange during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. It had a large engine (suggested by the noise made when active and the fact that it could carry a sidecar). It also appeared to have a kickstart.[1] Magic made it much larger than when it was manufactured, emitting a very loud roar. When Hagrid, a half-giant, rode it, the motorbike was large enough to fit him and could still carry an ordinary-sized person in its sidecar. Another spell made it able to fly fast enough to compete with a broomstick.",

However, there are some doors that cannot be opened by this knife, such as the door to the Love Chamber in the Department of Mysteries. That particular lock caused the blade to melt.",
